# RISCV-5-Stage-Pipeline

Updates: the ALU block is now working. I added a 4 bit number to the decoder output to control the ALU operation. The pipeline needs modification to support swapping the ALU input between immediates and registers (for addi and whatnot). Right now I have the immidiate value tied to one of the ALU inputs, but it isn't fully working correctly. \

Milestone 1: \
Josh - Program 1a \
Liam - Program 1b \
