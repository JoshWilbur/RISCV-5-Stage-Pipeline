# RISCV-5-Stage-Pipeline

Updates: Milestone 2a is working. I had to do a bit of a hack within the EX/MEM register file to get it working correctly. Data memory is word addressable, without the shift it would be treated as byte addressable. I don't like the solution as it feels like a hack, but it should suffice for now.

Milestone 1: \
Josh - Program 1a \
Liam - Program 1b


Milestone 2: \
Josh - Program 2a \
Liam - Program 2b \
