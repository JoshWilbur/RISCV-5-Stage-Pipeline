# RISCV-5-Stage-Pipeline

Updates: Changed the shift right by 2 to an external thing to make it easier to see and change. We should keep pipeline registers only piping and put anything else external to them to keep it clean. Changed some wiring around the memory to make RS2 the data for the memory and RS1 + imm the addr.
